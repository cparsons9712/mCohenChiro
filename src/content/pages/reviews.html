                I have seen Dr. Cohen here off and on for about 8 years. He is simply THE BEST! I especially appreciate his gentleness when I am in great pain. I only gave 4 stars because they don’t accept my Priority Health insurance, BUT they do give good cash rate options in these instances.

                I’ve been going here for about 15 years and my health wouldn’t be where it is today in the absence of routine chiropractic care. I see Dr. Cohen. The doctors and staff at Madison Chiropractic treat you like caring family in a very pleasant and welcoming office setting too which is such an added bonus. The treatment plans aren’t one size fits all either; they’re tailored to you and your unique wellness issues/concerns. At each appointment the doctor asks you how you’re feeling and adjusts accordingly.  I consider their fees very reasonable as well. Highly recommend!

Dr. Cohen was wonderful and clearly explained my condition, treatment, long and short term goals from the treatment etc...  There was no feeling of being rushed like in some medical offices. I highly recommend!  The doctors and the staff are excellent!

                Very educated and friendly staff. Dr. Cohen listened to all of my concerns, answered all of my questions, and gave me the spinal adjustment I needed. He asked if I wanted him to just adjust the part of my back that was hurting, or if I wanted the whole spine adjusted- I appreciate that he checked with me.

            <p class="cs-item-text">
                I have been a client here for over a year and have received excellent care from Dr. Cohen for my chronic low back and neck pain (after a bad fall).... They offer a variety of services here. Dr. Cohen is friendly and professional. When things were really bad with my back pain, I even had some appointments that lasted almost an hour with all the adjustments, stretches, and heat pads ... Dr. Cohen really cares about my well-being and wants to do everything in his power to help me feel better. ... In the past I have had chiropractors or doctors be "preachy" or condescending about lifestyle changes. This is not the case at Madison Heights Chiropractic Center. The other office staff are all extremely friendly and helpful. I barely have to wait 5 minutes after I arrive to begin my appointment. ...Overall, I feel very comfortable here and like I am getting excellent care. I have had a very large reduction in my pain and now only have to visit infrequently for booster adjustments.

                I have been seeing Dr. Cohen for about six years now. The very first time I went in, I could barely walk. Dr. Cohen did a complete physical on me and took x-rays and found out what I needed. He treated me three times each week for the first few weeks. After the second week, I felt like I was 20 years old again. I hav been going every two weeks since then.

            <p class="cs-item-text">
                I've been going to MHCC for just shy of a year and can say honestly they are very knowledgeable and detailed. I've been getting adjusted for 20 years or so (30 now) and can say hands down some of the best treatments I've had. Dr. Cohen does an excellent job of understanding, defining and treating your condition (even if you don't realize you may have one) or just keeping your spinal health well beyond what I was even aware of from past experiences. Highly recommend-

                Everyone at Madison Heights Chiropractic is wonderful! I have never seen Dr. Kash but Dr. Cohen is excellent! He will take the time to explain everything to you and help you understand your treatment and what you can do at home to help. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. Sometimes you can find a great doctor but have trouble with the staff but that is far from true at Madison Heights Chiropractic! Everyone I have dealt with has been extremely friendly and always goes the extra step to help.

            <p class="cs-item-text">
                This is my second chiropractic center and I feel its a good place compared to my previous one. Before visiting this place, I have gone through other reviews posted here and I have the similar health issue as Laura L -headaches and Lower back ; felt little confident that they can fix my issues, you know how hard to find a good doctor. After visiting, I felt the environment here is exactly same as mentioned in reviews. Its only one week and I am already feeling better with my pain. The staff is good , the treatment cost is decent & more important Dr.Cohen is very good (don't know about Dr.kash but he seems nice and friendly when he is around). He is very patient , takes time in explaining everything in detail and helps understanding the treatment process . He suggests what to do at home & work to help the pains not only that every time I go there he enquires about the pains with out missing & makes sure that I feel better.To me that's the indication of how much he pays attention to each patient. He is very caring and also goes beyond to help the patients.I rarely see such kind of people who really cares and willing to do more to help. I am planning to continue the treatment and hope the place gets more & more good . "I wish him all the success and good feedback"

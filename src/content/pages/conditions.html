              In the U.S., the terms lawyer and attorney are often used
              interchangeably. A lawyer provides legal services such as giving
              legal advice, writing legal documents and providing policy counsel
              to governments. An attorney, on top of these things also holds a
              state or regional license to represent clients in a law court.
